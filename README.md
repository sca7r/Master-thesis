# Zonal Convergence


## Overview
Zonal Convergence is a Python-based toolkit designed for optimizing the I/O wiring architecture in automobile platforms. The project leverages clustering and pathfinding algorithms to achieve efficient wiring topology by:
- Clustering I/O signals based on spatial proximity and functional zones using **K-Means**.
- Computing the shortest paths between I/O nodes, extenders, and HPCs using **Dijkstra's Algorithm**.

This repository facilitates the reduction of wiring complexity and supports the design of a modular, scalable zonal architecture.

## Features
- **K-Means Clustering**:
  - Groups I/O points based on spatial location and signal grouping.
  - Determines optimal number and placement of I/O extenders (Zonal ECUs).

- **Dijkstra Pathfinding**:
  - Calculates the shortest path for wiring between I/O devices, extenders, and central units (e.g., HPC).
  - Generates visual and quantitative analysis of wiring length and efficiency.
